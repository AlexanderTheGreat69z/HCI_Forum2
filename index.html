                            I got interested in the concept of programming when I was still at middle school. 
                            There was an extracurricular course aptly named 'Programming' and I was very interested 
                            so i joined alongside with some of my friends who were also interested in coding. 
                            We started off with Web Development but we weren't introduced to professional code editors such as VSC. 
                            So we coded in the most traditional way with the lovely writing application that came with almost every laptop which is Notepad. 
                            Then after a while we continued to general coding concepts used on most backend programming languages like C++, 
                            Python, and JavaScript (Back then, I studied all that in C++). Till this day I still question how these coding concepts can 
                            be implemented in a workplace and actually create something useful. The only time I knew how was on an Arduino where I coded things to do on the board with C. 
                            
                            <br><br>
        
                            Fast forward to high school, we get more detailed on those coding concepts. 
                            This time we actually used a code editor (specificly a compiler since we still used C++) 
                            except we still didn't use the professional ones like VSC and instead used an online compiler called onlinegdb 
                            and we used that for the 3 years of programming and informatics class. However, in the middle of my highschool years, 
                            My parents suggested me to join this well known coding course. I joined and we actually studied both WebDev and 
                            general coding concepts in an even more detailed version than the ones i studied so far at school. 
                            I also got to use VSC in the process and thats how I finally managed to get my hands on an actual professional code editor. 
                            Since then, I have never stopped using VSC as now that I have graduated to college and entered my most desired major, 
                            which is Computer Science. At this point, I can't work without VSC. 
                            
                            <br><br>
        
                            Getting back to the topic of my progress being a programmer, now that I'm in college studying Computer Science, 
                            I finally got to do more coding than having to suffer from useless knowledge that I probably wont use for the rest of my life. 
                            At this point, all the coding concepts are reviewed but now it's gotten really deep into the nooks and cranies of coding. 
                            But regardless, I still get to learn new things as I haven't even scraped the surface of what I could do in the programming world. 
                            It's a lot of fun but it's the kind of fun where you should know what you can do as it is very blurry from the start

                            I cant remember exactly when I started playing games but one thing's for sure is that I started off playing a mobile game called Mobile Legends 
                            with my friends back in primary school. I got interested for a while until I got bored of it and eventually quit. 
                            I have to admit that along the years I did come back a couple times but the result was still the same... I got bored and eventually quit again. 
                            
                            <br><br> 
    
                            From primary to middle school, I never exactly knew how people played PC games until sometime I heard about Steam. 
                            I had it during middle school but I still never got the idea on how to use it as the laptop I had was not too great when it comes to opening games 
                            and Steam back then was a very complicated thing to work around for me. So I just had it in my PC with a couple games that I usually played back then 
                            and it wasn't that much. Can't remember the other games but one prominent game that i remember playing so much was Geometry Dash. 
                            Its exciting and frustrating at the same time but in the end I kept playing the game for a while (And this feeling is very important on the long run). 
                            I could play official levels, player-made levels, and even make my own level in the game. It's always such a joy for me if I could make something of my own in a game. 
                            Knowing that I can make my own level in there and share it to others to play, I was very interested and fascinated with understanding on how to make decent GD levels. 
                            Then in 9th grade, It was online learning period and during that time I actually got bored of GD at some point and ended up not playing games on PC for a while 
                            but continued playing games in the PS4. 
                            
                            <br><br>
    
                            When I reached highschool, I made lots of new friends and my friends introduced me to a 5v5 bomb defusal game called Valorant. 
                            Since I was so excited to play w my new friends, I immediately started downloading the game and played it once it's done downloading. 
                            Since it was my first time playing a 5v5 bomb defusal game, I looked completely stupid playing it. The only thing i know about the game is that one of 
                            my mission is to eliminate the enemies and prevent them from planting the bomb (or in Valorant's case, it's called 'the spike'). 
                            For the weapons for elimination, there were a list of weapons to buy. From the wdecent default pistol givenm at the start of every round to the most expensive 
                            and strongest sniper that can end an enemy in one shot to the body, the weapon choices are limitless... with a price and proper decision making of course. 
                            Since then until now, I still play that game followed by another bomb defusal game that's recently got a huge update and remaster called Counter-Strike 2 
                            (was called Counter Strike: Global Offensive previously). There are lots of other games that I play on my PC nowadays. 100 Steam games, and a couple more non Steam games. 
                            Unfortunately, not a lot of people around me play the majority of games I have. Also Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail are shit. period.

                        I play lots of games, actually. I have nearly 100 games on Steam and I also play other games that are non-Steam.<br>
                        But these are the games that I 'mostly' play:
                        <ul>
                            <li>

                                <p>
                                    I really love playing bomb defusal games especially with friends. just hope I had more friends who play one of those game.<br>

                        I was born smart, i guess. I just dont know how to tell people on how to be as smart as I am, but one thing I do is to just try understanding a concept easily
                        by rephrasing everything in your own language. Thats a lot easier than to stick with long-ass complicated explanations

                        Not really as I haven't watched it. But my guess is that you're probably asking me that because of my middle name. My dad gave me
                        that and he's a fan. Not me though. I'm a fan of JJBA hehe
